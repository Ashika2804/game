# Snake game using Reactjs.



- Developed a Live Snake game using React JS.
- Implemented a Responsive Design that allows the game to be played on desktop and mobile devices.
- In this classic Snake game, players control a snake to eat food, growing longer with each meal.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- Use the (keys/Buttons) UP, DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT to make the snake grow longer.
- You can't stop the snake or make it go backwards.
- The goal is to make the snake as large as possible.
